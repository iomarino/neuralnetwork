This repo contains implementations of various flavours of neural networks written from scratch in C allowing maximum customizability.  
The file feedforward.c contains a general implementation of a fully-connected feedforward neural network, and it performs both training and then predictions on the test data, which is then output to a file. It supports sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU activation functions for the hidden layers while softmax has been hard-coded for the output layer; it also assumes cross-entropy as loss function.
The train and test data should be in the same directory of the executable. The MNIST dataset in CSV format can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cANqXh282D8pDhnbBXysiaRqhmR5y5UW/view).
